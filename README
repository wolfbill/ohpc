These instructions describe how to build PBS from source using rpmbuild
under CentOS 7.

Before getting started, you should have three files:
1. README (the file you are currently reading)
2. pbspro.spec
3. pbspro-[VERSION].tar.gz

PBS is installed in the /opt/pbs directory by default. This may be
changed by editing the pbs.spec file and modifying the value of
pbs_prefix defined near the top. This alters the prefix value passed
to configure. 

Building PBS:

Setup the RPM development tree (~/rpmbuild) if not already present using
one of the following methods.

If you have the rpmdevtools package installed, run the following:

$ rpmdev-setuptree
$ ls ~/rpmbuild
BUILD  BUILDROOT  RPMS  SOURCES  SPECS  SRPMS
$

You may also create the directories manually. For a 64 bit system,
run the following:

$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild
$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild/RPMS
$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild/BUILD
$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT
$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
$ mkdir ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

Place the pbs.spec file in the ~/rpmbuild/SPECS directory.

Place the pbspro-[VERSION].tar.gz file in the ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES directory.

Start the build:

$ cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
$ rpmbuild -bb pbspro.spec
Executing(%prep): /bin/sh -e /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.gF43VM
...

The RPM packages may be found in the ~/rpmbuilds/RPMS/x86_64 directory
when the build completes. Use yum (as root) to install the PBS package:

$ cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
$ sudo yum install pbspro-server-[VERSION].x86_64.rpm
